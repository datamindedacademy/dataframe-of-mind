# Windowing and Aggregations

Windowing and aggregations lie at the core of analytics: you course-grain information by aggregating it within a suitable context, or grouping of records. Aggregate values often allow us to identify key trends or patterns in the underlying data, which can further inform decisions to optimize our operational processes.

## Task

In this, we are going to answer some questions of interest to the medical staff of the Zoo by aggregating and windowing data:

- When was the first and last measurement of each bear taken?
- For each lifestage group of polar bears and for each year, which polar bear was the most active (most amount of steps per day)?
- For every year, figure out which polar bear was the heaviest.
- Find out which bears were more anxious (higher blood pressure) than average the day after New Year's Eve (probably because of fireworks)?

If you're up for a challenge:
- Which polar bear has the highest risk of becoming a diabetic? (polar bears have a higher risk of becoming diabetic after going through a high blood sugar level episode. An episode is defined as a three-day or longer period of an average daily bgl of 200 )
