This repository contains the exercises for the course around DataFrames and data processing with two different analytics engines: Polars and Pyspark.

For each exercise, there is a Markdown file included in the folder of the exercise, with an in-depth explanation of the goal of the exercise and how to get started. 

Some handy links you will probably need to complete the exercises:
